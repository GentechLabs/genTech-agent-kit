# Context Cycle — Proactive Save & Resume

## When to Use
- Conversation/working context reaches **80-90%** and you can't make room (the trigger).
- Mid-way through a big build and you hit a natural stopping point.
- The user says "save progress," "start new," "load a new context," or "/new."
- You notice memory pressure and want to save before it drops the ball.

## The Problem This Solves
Even with a large context window, active build sessions fill up fast. When context hits
~80-90% and you can't make room, the session degrades and work gets dropped. This is the
**proactive** protocol: you detect the pressure, save your place to the brain, route the
log to the right channel, load a fresh context, and pick the task back up.

## The Cycle — 5 Steps (Save → Route → Load → Resume)

### Step 1: SAVE progress to the brain (vault / second brain)
Write a dated progress file to the vault so nothing is lost. Use the context bridge
generator if available, then fill it in:
```bash
python3 <path-to>/session-hygiene/scripts/context-save.py   # if present in the agent
```
Capture the real content (bridge path varies by setup; the principle is the same):
- **Active work**: what you were building, current task, dependencies
- **Decisions made**: the calls taken + reasoning
- **Blockers**: anything stuck or needing the user/another lane
- **Next steps**: the exact resume point, so the next session picks up cleanly

**Rule:** Save where you are BEFORE you move on. Never let memory fill up and drop the ball.

### Step 2: ROUTE the log to the right channel
Decide where the progress note belongs. This is the agent's judgment call — where does
this work need to live, and who needs to see it?

| Content | Channel / folder |
|---|---|
| Coordination, decisions, blockers, status | **HQ** (your main group, `00-HQ/`) |
| Ideas, considerations, open questions | **Mess Hall** (`11-Mess Hall/considerations.md`) |
| Heavy build / code / dev progress | **Labs** (`01-HANDOFFS/gentech-to-labs/`) |
| Finance / treasury / yield | **Treasury** (`01-HANDOFFS/gentech-to-treasury/`) |
| Content / social / hackathon | **Entertainment** (`01-HANDOFFS/gentech-to-entertainment/`) |

For cross-agent work, drop a handoff file into the relevant `01-HANDOFFS/<lane>/` folder
so that lane's agent picks it up on wake-up. Sync the vault after writing so the second
brain and backups have it: `cd <vault> && ob sync` (or your repo's sync command).

### Step 3: LOAD a fresh context
Compact / start a new session so the context window is clear. Tell the user:
> "Memory at [X]% — saved progress to the brain, logged to [channel]. Ready for /new?"

If /new isn't wanted yet, at minimum clear the working context via compaction so the
window is fresh but the save is already in the vault.

### Step 4: RESUME the task
On the fresh session (or after compaction), load the resume point:
1. Read the latest context bridge / `latest-context.md`
2. Read the relevant handoff file if you wrote one in Step 2
3. Re-establish: what was in progress, decisions, next steps
4. Continue the task from the exact checkpoint — do NOT restart it

### Step 5: CONFIRM continuity
Verify the resume landed: the task picks up where it stopped, no duplicate work, and
the next cycle starts from the new checkpoint. If anything was lost, recover from the
vault archive / session search rather than redoing it.

## Context Thresholds — tiered by model window (Jordan approved Aug 11 2026)

The execute point depends on the model's context window, not one flat number. A single
threshold either churns fast agents (interrupting healthy long builds) or strands slow ones.

| Agent | Window | 80% (think) | Execute save | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Forge (DeepSeek Flash) | 5M tokens | 85% | **90%** | Huge headroom, quality holds late |
| Gentech (GLM 5.2 / DeepSeek V4 Flash) | 128K | 80% | **85%** | Degrade begins past ~85% |
| Gentech Flash (GLM 4.5 Flash) | 64K | 80% | **80%** | Small window fills fast, degrade hits earlier |

**Rule (Jordan):** save EARLY rather than late. At 80% you don't wait — you assess the
road ahead (next task size, next stop) and start the save if the path looks long. Losing
a save is never worth pushing context to the limit. The 85/90 execute is the firm
backstop; the 80% assessment + natural-stopping-point rule is the real protection.

## Pitfalls
- **Don't skip Step 1 (save)** — routing to a channel without first saving progress means
  the next session has no resume point.
- **Don't just say "memory's full"** — always execute the cycle: save → route → load → resume.
- **Don't restart a finished task** — if the save shows the task was complete, don't redo it.
- **Cross-agent work needs a handoff file** — logging to your own group alone doesn't wake
  up the other agents.
- **Sync the brain** — a local file nobody pushed doesn't help other agents or backups.

## Verification
After a cycle, confirm:
1. Progress saved to the context bridge (dated file exists)
2. Log routed to the correct channel/handoff folder
3. Brain synced (sync command ran)
4. Resume point identified in the latest bridge file
5. Fresh context loaded; task resumes from the checkpoint, not from scratch
